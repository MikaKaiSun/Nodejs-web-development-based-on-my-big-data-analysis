Hot use pot mining about Kunming
Through the big data analysis of the posts of Sina Weibo, China’s largest social networking platform, 
reached key words’ frequency of use and general hot use location, 
then made keyword positioning combined with the point of interest (POI) acquisition, 
with potential commercial value such as targeted advertising, etc.

It was connected to MySQL which stored my results of DBSCAN analysis. I will upload it soon.
